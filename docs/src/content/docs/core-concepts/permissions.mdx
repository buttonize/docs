## Creating a custom permission group

If you have a Business tier, you can create a custom permission group in the [Permissions](https://app.buttonize.io/organization?scene=permissions) settings.

**Demo**

## Organization owner

Every organization has an owner. By default it's the one who created it. Owner has permissions to do everything regardless being in any permission group.

### Organization ownership transfer

You can find the organization ownership transfer in the [General](https://app.buttonize.io/organization?scene=general) settings. You can see the option only if you are the owner.
