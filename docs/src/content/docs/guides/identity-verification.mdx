One of the example apps we've built to demonstrate the business problems Buttonize can solve is
an app for our identity verification team.

If you work in FinTech, it's quite common to have users submit documents for identity verification. If your business
handles reviewing these documents in-house, this is the perfect time to help out your compliance team and use Buttonize!

## The Example on GitHub

The code for this example can be found [in our examples repo](https://github.com/buttonize/buttonize/tree/master/examples/identity-verification).
Please check it out and get acquainted.

One import thing to note is that in order to use the local development tooling with Buttonize, you _must_ export your CDK app,
as can be seen [here](https://github.com/buttonize/buttonize/blob/master/examples/identity-verification/bin/identity-verification.ts#L8).

If you don't plan to use the local development features, then this step is optional.

This guide is very similar to our guide for our example [Customer Support App](/guides/customer-support/). Reading only one of two is necessary.

## IdentityVerificationStack

In this guide, we'll skip some of the general concepts already covered in the [Help Request Form Guide](/guides/help-request-form/). If
you're new to building apps with Buttonize or haven't read that guide yet, we recommend doing so.

Anyways, here's a high level overview of what our identity verification app with all its pages looks like:

```typescript
new ButtonizeApp(this, 'IdentityVerificationApp')
	.page('LoadUserPage', {
		body: [
			// ...
		]
	})
	.page('DocumentVerificationPage', {
		body: [
			// ...
		]
	})
	.page('ConfirmationPage', {
		body: [
			// ...
		]
	})
```

Within each page's `body` prop, we then layout what our app should look like and which actions certain components should take
when interacted with.

## LoadUserPage (the first page)

In our first page, we provide a form for our compliance team to load the user they're trying to help into the app. This
page is fairly straightforward:

```typescript
body: [
	Display.grid([
		{
			size: 1,
			body: [
				Input.text({
					id: 'userId',
					label: 'User Id'
				})
			]
		},
		{
			size: 1,
			body: [
				Input.button({
					label: 'Load User',
					onClick: Action.aws.lambda.invoke(
						new NodejsFunction(this, 'IdentityVerificationLoadUserLambda', {
							handler: 'handler',
							entry: path.join(__dirname, `loadUserHandler.ts`),
							runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X
						}),
						{
							Payload: {
								userId: '{{userId}}'
							}
						},
						{
							id: 'loadUserPayload'
						}
					),
					onClickFinished: Action.buttonize.app.changePage(
						'DocumentVerificationPage'
					),
					kind: 'secondary',
					intent: 'default'
				})
			]
		}
	])
]
```

We simply need an `Input.text` field where our colleague can enter the user id, and an `Input.button` component.
In order to get the components to display side-by-side, we're using `Input.grid`. If we wanted them stacked vertically,
we could also just do it like:

```typescript
body: [
	Input.text({
		id: 'userId',
		label: 'User Id'
	}),
	Input.button({
		label: 'Load User',
		onClick: Action.aws.lambda.invoke(...),
		onClickFinished: Action.buttonize.app.changePage(...),
		kind: 'secondary',
		intent: 'default'
	})
]
```

Also note our use of the `kind` and `intent` props in order to style the button. Your intellisense should make it
clear which values are available for this buttons, and you'll be able to give them the colors and styles you want.

When the button is pressed, it'll invoke a lamba to fetch the user data. Once it's done, we'll be sent to
the next page in order to present the data.

```typescript
import { Handler } from 'aws-lambda'

export const handler: Handler = async (event, context) => {
	// Here, you can load the user info from your database
	const userId = event.userId
	// for this example, we just return hardcoded data
	return {
		image: 'https://teara.govt.nz/files/d-23817-pc_2.jpg',
		rawData:
			'{\n  "metadata": {\n    "reason": "Document expiration"\n  },\n  "firstDeposit": false,\n  "country": "NZ",\n  "risk_level": 2\n}'
	}
}
```

Since this is just an example, you can see we're only returning some hardcoded data, but your lambda could fetch
the data from anywhere! Anything you can do within a lambda, you can kick off from Buttonize.

Once this lambda returns, we invoke `Action.buttonize.app.changePage` via the `onClickFinished` prop of the button
and move on to the specified page.

## DocumentVerificationPage (the second page)

On this page, we display all the info we have on the user, present their documentation, and give the compliance team
the ability to approve or reject the document.

The main thing to take note of is that the user data is accessed through the `loadUserPayload` variable, which
is from the [Runtime State](/core-concepts/runtime-state/), which was populated on the first page via our lamba action.
After the lambda returned, it extracted the data from the response and inserted it into `loadUserPayload`. Now
we can use that data in order to meaningful context to our page.

```typescript
body: [
	Display.grid([
		{
			size: 2,
			body: [
				Display.image('{{loadUserPayload.image}}'),
				Display.code('{{loadUserPayload.rawData}}', { language: 'json' })
			]
		},
		{
			size: 2,
			body: [
				Input.button({
					label: 'Approve document',
					onClick: Action.aws.lambda.invoke(
						new NodejsFunction(this, 'ApproveDocumentLambda', {
							handler: 'handler',
							entry: path.join(__dirname, `approveDocument.ts`),
							runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X
						}),
						{
							Payload: {
								userId: '{{userId}}'
							}
						}
					),
					onClickFinished: Action.buttonize.app.changePage('ConfirmationPage'),
					kind: 'secondary',
					intent: 'positive'
				}),
				Display.text('Not sure? Check guidlines', { spacingBottom: 'lg' }),
				Input.select({
					id: 'reason',
					label: 'Select reason',
					options: [{ label: 'Document is too blurry', value: 'too_blurry' }],
					spacingBottom: 'md',
					spacingTop: 'lg'
				}),
				Input.text({
					id: 'notes',
					label: 'Notes (optional)'
				}),
				Input.button({
					label: 'Reject document',
					onClick: Action.aws.lambda.invoke(
						new NodejsFunction(this, 'RejectDocumentLambda', {
							handler: 'handler',
							entry: path.join(__dirname, `rejectDocument.ts`),
							runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X
						}),
						{
							Payload: {
								userId: '{{userId}}',
								reason: '{{reason.value}}',
								notes: '{{notes}}'
							}
						}
					),
					onClickFinished: Action.buttonize.app.changePage('ConfirmationPage'),
					kind: 'secondary',
					intent: 'negative'
				})
			]
		}
	])
]
```

One thing of note is our use of the `Display.code` component. In this example, it demonstrates presenting some raw json
data we haven't gotten around to building a UI for. However, such data can still be useful, so why not show it?

Moving on to the interactability, notice how each action invokes a lambda, accessing some data from the
[Runtime State](/core-concepts/runtime-state/) in order to populate the payload.

Each lambda is just an example, but it should be clear that it's here where you would insert your business logic.

```typescript
import { Handler } from 'aws-lambda'

export const handler: Handler = async (event, context) => {
	// Here, you can make an API call to handle the approval
	const userId = event.userId

	console.log(`User ${userId} document approved`)

	return {
		success: true
	}
}
```

Notice how `userId` is the variable we provided in the payload of our action.

Once this lambda returns, the `onClickFinished` callback is invoked and the flow continues.

## ConfirmationPage (the third page)

The code for this is simple since it just displays text, confirming that we approved or rejected this particular
user's documents.

```typescript
body: [Display.text('User {{userId}} updated')]
```

Notice we're just using `userId`, which was actually set in the first page.

In this example, while each button invokes its own lambda, we redirect to the same page via the `onClickFinished` callback,
but, if desired, you could instead redirect to a discrete confirmation page for each action.

## Wrapping Up

That's about it for this example app. If you're already familiar with the [lambda invoke Action](/actions/aws/lambda-invoke/)
and the [change page Action](/actions/buttonize/change-page/), this should be pretty straightforward.

Hopefully you found this example useful. Now go build something!
