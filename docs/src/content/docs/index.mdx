### Problems with internal tooling

Internal tooling is indefinite problem. We all have in our companies all these "temporary" tools that
have been here forever and have many different funny names and everybody is afraid to touch their code.

When deciding about building internal tooling companies usually have three options

1. Build the app from scratch - API + auth + frontend + indefinite maintenance
2. Use drag-and-drop platform such as Retool - all developers hat no-code tools
3. Create Slack bots - text interface is sufficient only fir a small number of use-cases

### Buttonize comes to the rescue

We think these three principles are important when solving business problem via internal tools.

- Minimize future maintenance
- Build it quickly
- Don't reinvent the wheel

Buttonize gives you a way to build and deploy internal apps via tools you already use. We provide your with
[CDK Constructs](https://github.com/buttonize/buttonize) with simple interface that allow you to define UI components
and connect them to AWS. No need to worry about anything else. Just run `cdk deploy`. That's it.
